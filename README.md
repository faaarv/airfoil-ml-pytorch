# airfoil-ml-pytorch
Train a model to predict Airfoil Lift/Drag Coefficient using Pytorch

The dataset utilized in this project is a comprehensive collection of airfoil data, available through: https://github.com/nasa/airfoil-learning. 

It uses Pytorch to train a model on this dataset, so it can predict aerodynamic coeffiecients
